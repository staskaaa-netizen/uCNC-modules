# ESP32 PCNT Encoder

ESP32-only uCNC custom encoder module using the ESP32 PCNT peripheral for spindle
quadrature counting. It is intended for lathe spindle feedback and G33 threading.

## What It Does

- Uses one PCNT unit for encoder A/B quadrature.
- Extends the signed 16-bit PCNT value in software with an offset.
- Recenters the hardware PCNT counter before it reaches the 16-bit edge.
- Uses an optional second PCNT unit as a hardware mailbox for the Z/index pulse.
- Reports index interval statistics through the normal encoder status helpers.
- Can publish a virtual `enc0_index` hook from the PCNT index mailbox for G33.

With the index PCNT enabled, the Z pulse does not need the normal uCNC DIN ISR
path. The Z pin is counted by PCNT hardware and drained from the module task
loop. This avoids the ESP32 GPIO ISR path for the index pulse while still giving
G33 the same hook it already expects.

## Basic Configuration

Example for encoder 0:

```c
#define ENC0_TYPE ENC_TYPE_CUSTOM

#define ENC0_PULSE_GPIO 15
#define ENC0_DIR_GPIO 17
#define ENC0_PCNT_UNIT PCNT_UNIT_0

#define ENC0_IS_INCREMENTAL
#define ENC0_READ_WRAP 65536UL
#define ENC0_CPR 4000

#define SPINDLE_PWM_RPM_ENCODER ENC0
#define G33_ENCODER ENC0
```

`ENC0_PULSE_GPIO` is encoder A. `ENC0_DIR_GPIO` is encoder B.

## Filters

`ENCODER_PCNT_FILTER` is in PCNT APB clock ticks, not microseconds. On classic
ESP32 the APB clock is normally 80 MHz:

```text
80 ticks ~= 1 us
```

Example:

```c
#define ENCODER_PCNT_FILTER 160  // about 2 us
```

Keep this shorter than the real A/B high or low pulse width at maximum spindle
RPM, or real encoder pulses can be filtered out.

## Index Without GPIO ISR

The index pulse can be captured by a separate PCNT unit:

```c
#define ENC0_INDEX_GPIO DIN5_BIT
#define ENC0_INDEX_PCNT_UNIT PCNT_UNIT_1
#define ENC0_INDEX_PCNT_FILTER 10
```

This config makes PCNT count rising Z/index edges. The index pulse is not gated
by encoder A/B, so it behaves symmetrically in both rotation directions.

The task loop reads and clears only the index PCNT counter. It does not reset the
main encoder counter.

Do not also enable the normal DIN ISR for the same index input when using index
PCNT. For example, if the index is on `DIN5`, leave `DIN5_ISR` undefined. The
module will invoke the virtual `enc0_index` hook after the PCNT mailbox reports a
Z pulse.

If `ENC0_INDEX_PCNT_UNIT` is not defined, the module falls back to the normal
uCNC `enc0_index` hook. With `DIN5_ISR` enabled on ESP32, that hook is driven by
the GPIO interrupt path, not by slow main-loop level polling. The same min/max
cap and UI debug line are still used. This fallback was useful for comparison,
but the PCNT index path is the preferred ESP32 solution.

By default, accepted index-to-index intervals are checked against the configured
encoder resolution from GRBL setting `$150` for encoder 0. The default window is:

```text
min = $150 * 0.75
max = $150 * 1.25
```

For `$150=4000`, this accepts `3000..5000`.

The window can still be overridden at compile time:

```c
#define ENC0_INDEX_MIN_DELTA 3000
#define ENC0_INDEX_MAX_DELTA 5000
```

The module keeps the encoder position at the last accepted index and calculates:

- live delta since the last accepted index
- last accepted revolution count
- min/max accepted revolution count
- accepted index count

If the `ui_snapshot` integration from this modules branch is used, the debug line
is copied into the snapshot and rendered by `ra8876_display` only when it changes.
It is not printed directly from the encoder task loop.

Example debug line:

```text
ENCIDX EC:-5269 ECB:0 LAST:-4001 AVG:4000.1 MIN:-4002 MAX:4003 N:34 HW:35 IGN:0 BAD:0 MISS:0
```

Fields:

- `EC`: current extended encoder count
- `ECB`: live count since the last accepted index
- `LAST`: count between the last two accepted indexes
- `AVG`: average absolute count between accepted indexes
- `MIN`/`MAX`: accepted interval range
- `N`: accepted index intervals
- `HW`: raw index pulses counted by the index PCNT unit
- `IGN`: ignored too-small deltas, usually same-slot recrossing near reverse
- `BAD`: reserved for impossible intervals that are not classified as missed
- `MISS`: extra or over-cap Z interval, usually software did not process an index
  interval in time

## G33 Compatibility

G33 listens to the normal uCNC encoder index hook. When index PCNT is enabled,
this module invokes that same hook from the PCNT index mailbox. So G33 does not
need a special ISR-capable DIN pin for this ESP32 PCNT solution.

For repeat G33 commands, the bundled `g33` module clears its internal index
timestamps/counters at the start of each G33 move. This avoids stale index timing
from a previous thread move being reused by the next command.

If index PCNT is not configured, the module falls back to the normal uCNC
`enc0_index` hook path. In that fallback mode the selected index input still
needs to work through the normal uCNC DIN polling/ISR mechanism.

## Notes

- ESP32 PCNT counters are still limited internally. The extended position is
  software-maintained by this module.
- `ENC0_PCNT_RECENTER_THRESHOLD` defaults to `20000`, keeping the raw PCNT value
  away from the signed 16-bit boundary.
- `ENCODER_PCNT_FILTER` and `ENC0_INDEX_PCNT_FILTER` are PCNT filter ticks, not
  microseconds. On classic ESP32, `80` ticks is about `1 us`.
- GPIO34-GPIO39 on classic ESP32 are input-only and have no internal pullups or
  pulldowns. Use proper external biasing or a driven encoder output.
