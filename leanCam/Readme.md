# LeanCam — µCNC Conversational Lathe Mode

LeanCam is a lightweight, operator-focused conversational programming layer for µCNC.
It provides fast, keypad-driven lathe programming using structured text blocks instead of raw G-code.

---

## 1. Purpose

LeanCam is designed to:

* enable fast shop-floor programming
* minimize required inputs
* provide predictable and consistent behavior
* work within µCNC / GRBL-style constraints
* feel like a real conversational controller without full CNC complexity

---

## 2. Coordinate System (LOCKED)

### Z Axis

* `Z0` = front face of the part
* `Z negative` = into material (towards chuck)
* `Z positive` = away from material

Example:

* front face → `Z 0`
* 50 mm into stock → `Z -50`

---

### X Axis

* Diameter mode
* `X = diameter`

---

### Stock Range

```
Z range = [ +eL ... -L ]
```

---

### Safety Positions

* `X_safe = oD + safe`
* `Z_safe = +eL + safe`

---

## 3. UI Model

LeanCam uses conversational blocks:

1. Sticky setup block (top)
2. Cycle list
3. Draft/edit area
4. Simulation area (separate)

G-code is optional and derived.

---

## 4. Setup Block

### Required

* `oD` — outer diameter
* `L` — length

### Defaults

* `iD = 0`
* `cL = 0`
* `eL = 0`
* `mT = ST45`
* `safe = 2`

---

## 5. Default Resolution (LOCKED)

Fields referencing setup are resolved **during draft creation**.

Example:

```
D1{(SETUP.OD)}
-> D1{60}
```

---

## 6. Cycle Set (Initial)

* OD turn
* Face
* Groove
* Drill
* Bore

---

## 7. Draft Entry Mode (CORE BEHAVIOR)

When a cycle is selected, LeanCam enters **draft mode**.

### Behavior

* Line is shown but not committed
* First required field is selected automatically
* Active field is highlighted
* Input is temporary until accepted

---

### Workflow

1. Select cycle
2. Draft appears
3. Enter value
4. Press `ENTER` → accept field
5. Move to next field
6. Skip optional fields with ENTER
7. Press `END (#)` → commit
8. Press `ESC (*)` → cancel

---

## 8. Input Model (Keypad)

* digits → numeric input
* `ENTER` → accept field
* `#` → commit block
* `*` → cancel

Navigation:

* `8 / 2` → up / down
* `4 / 6` → field navigation

---

## 9. Field States

Each field can be:

* required
* defaulted
* inherited
* filled
* invalid

---

## 10. Field Highlighting

Active field is visually highlighted.

* Windows prototype → inverse colors
* Embedded UI → color/box highlight

While editing:

* input buffer is shown live
* value applied only after ENTER

---

## 11. Tool Behavior

* First cycle requires tool
* Subsequent cycles reuse tool automatically
* Operator can override at any time

---

## 12. Material Handling

Material is defined in setup (`mT`).

Tool + material determines:

* feed
* speed
* DOC

Implementation strategy is deferred.

---

## 13. Validation (Initial)

### Setup valid if:

* `oD > 0`
* `L > 0`
* `iD < oD`

### OD cycle valid if:

* setup exists
* tool exists
* final diameter ≤ stock diameter

---

## 14. Display Model

* Setup block always visible
* Stock drawing reflects setup
* Simulation separate from text

---

## 15. Asset Mapping (LOCKED)

UI assets are derived from module name.

Example:

```
OD -> od.bmp   (helper image)
OD -> od.ico   (button icon)
```

Rules:

* module name = text before first `|`
* filenames are lowercase
* no metadata fields required

---

## 16. Implementation Notes

* Conversational lines are plain text
* Parser is string-based
* No AST or complex structure
* Draft buffer used before commit
* UI and logic are strictly separated

---

## 17. Development Status

LeanCam currently provides:

* working parser model
* draft entry workflow
* setup-based default resolution
* field navigation and editing
* UI highlighting

Next steps:

* file save/load
* G-code generation
* tool/material database
* ESP32 UI integration

---

## 18. Philosophy

LeanCam follows:

* simplicity over completeness
* deterministic behavior over magic
* operator speed over configurability

---

## 19. Summary

LeanCam is a minimal but practical conversational layer that:

* reduces input to essentials
* keeps logic transparent
* enables fast real-world usage

## File Format

LeanCam uses a simple text-based `.lcam` format.
